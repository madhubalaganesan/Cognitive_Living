# Cognitive_Living
A Home Automation System which aims at providing a comfortable, physiologically ambient environment for Safe and Secure living. The motives are as follows: 

*	Energy aware living & steps towards saving energy 
*	Cost saving by reducing power consumption
*	A system that can automatically understand userâ€™s needs

Implemented a system with DHS HomeManager, FHEM and HomeMatic devices which can provide comfort, security and save energy in a household. We have a Web front end which shows three operating modes namely : Normal Mode, Shield Mode and Child Mode. The system can predict and adapt itself based on user behavior.
